# Alignments

Codon-alignments of the centroid nucleotide sequence of sequences dereplicated and clustered at 95% identity. Sequences were trimmed to the C1 and T motifs inclusive, and any sequences not containing these motifs were removed. The files flagged with "_gb" were processed to remove regions of ambiguous alignment using GBLOCK version 0.91b29. The default parameters were used for GBLOCK except the minimum number of sequences for a flank position was set equal to 50% of the total sequences, the minimum length of a block was 5, and gap positions were allowed in half of the sequences.
