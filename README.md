# NRPS_evolution

Files used for the evolutionary analysis of NRPSs from *Pseudomonas*, *Streptomyces* and *Bacillus* genera.

Full details of analysis are given in our paper: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.28.970632

The files for treeorder scan and recombination analysis are in the folders SSE and RDP4, respectively. These analyses used the alignments from the "Alignments" folder. The alignments were generated using domains extracted from the antiSMASH database, which are in the folder Raw_sequences.

The scripts and alignments for running SCHEMA analysis are in the folder named Schema_Bar_Graph.
