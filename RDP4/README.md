# RDP4 analysis

These files contain the files for RDP4 analysis. Default settings were used except sequences were specified as linear, only recombination events detected by at least three methods were considered and alignment consistency was unchecked. A breakpoint distribution plot can be created using a 200 bp window and 1,000 permutations.
